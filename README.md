### ‚ú® Demo

![](demo.gif)

## Installation

```bash
sudo npm install -g pr-filler
```

## Prerequisites

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_github_token"
export OPEN_AI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode
pr-filler

# With PR URL as argument
pr-filler https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# With AI model specification
pr-filler --url https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --model gpt-4o

# Using short flags
pr-filler -u https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 -m gpt-3.5-turbo
```

## Command-line flags

- `--url, -u`: Specify the GitHub pull request URL
- `--model, -m`: Specify the OpenAI model to use (default: gpt-4.1)

## How it works

1. Fetches the existing PR template and code diff from GitHub
2. Sends both to the specified OpenAI model (default: gpt-4.1) to generate a detailed description
3. Updates the PR body on GitHub with the AI-generated content
